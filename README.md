# CS50 Problem Set: Mario

This is a solution to the "Mario" problem set from Harvard's CS50 course. Copying this data and using it for your submission will breach the academic honesty https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/honesty/ policy of CS50.

The problem requires creating a program in C that prints out a pyramid of hashtags, similar to the iconic pyramid from the game Super Mario Bros.

## Description

The program prompts the user for the height of the pyramid and then prints out the pyramid with the specified number of rows using hashtags. The pyramid is right-aligned and separated by two spaces in the middle.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., gcc).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

  `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cs50-mario.git`

3. Navigate to the repository directory:
  `cd cs50-mario`

4. Run the program:
   `./mario`

5. Follow the prompts to enter the height of the pyramid.
 ```bash
   Height: 5
